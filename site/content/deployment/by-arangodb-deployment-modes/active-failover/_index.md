This section describes how to deploy an _Active Failover_ environment.

For a general introduction to _Active Failover_, please refer to the
[Active Failover](../../../architecture/arangodb-deployment-modes/active-failover/) chapter.

There are two main ways to start an _Active Failover_ setup:

1. using the [_ArangoDB Starter_](deployment-active-failover-using-the-starter) (possibly in conjunction with
docker), or
1. [manually](deployment-active-failover-manual-start).
